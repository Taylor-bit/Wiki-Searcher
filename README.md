# Wiki-Searcher

Utilizes Python Wikipedia module to, depending on the subdomain used, return the results of the appropriate search on wikipedia 

For testing purposes, change the host header to "dogs.wiki-search.com:5000" 

To get a return of a page that indexes multiple possible results change the host header to "ordinary.wiki-search.com:5000"



Future Improvements:

Rework to remove dependency on wikipedia library by using BeautifulSoup to scrape WAY less data per page
